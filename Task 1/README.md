> Task troubleshooting 


Faced an error stating the “Reinitialized existing Git repository in /home/devasc/Documents/Skills2022/.git/”

This meant that there was no connection to the remote repo. To check this, we had to move to the previous directory and the git status

So we had to add the git connection in the desired “Skills2022” directory:
